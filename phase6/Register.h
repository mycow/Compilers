/*
 * File:	Register.h
 *
 * Description:	This file contains the class definition for registers on
 *		the Intel 64-bit processor.  Each register has three
 *		operand names depending upon the access size.  Our
 *		assembler syntax refers to these as an 8-bit byte, a 32-bit
 *		long word (since a word is historically 16-bits), and a
 *		64-bit quad word.  By default, the 64-bit quad word name
 *		will be used.
